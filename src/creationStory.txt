Creation Story and The Importance Of Dreaming
An Abenaki Legend

The Great Spirit, in a time not known to us looked
about and saw nothing. No colors, no beauty. Time was silent in
darkness. There was no sound. Nothing could be seen or felt. The
Great Spirit decided to fill this space with light and life.
 From his great power he commanded the sparks of creation. He ordered
Tôlba, the Great Turtle to come from the waters and become
the land. The Great Spirit molded the mountains and the valleys
on turtle's back. He put white clouds into the blue skies. He was
very happy.He said, "Everything is ready now. I will fill this
place with the happy movement of life."He thought and thought
about what kind of creatures he would make.
Where would they live? What would they do? What would their purpose
be? He wanted a perfect plan. He thought so hard that he became
very tired and fell asleep.

His sleep was filled with dreams of his creation. He saw strange
things in his dream. He saw animals crawling on four legs, some
on two. Some creatures flew with wings, some swam with fins. There
were plants of all colors, covering the ground everywhere. Insects
buzzed around, dogs barked, birds sang, and human beings called
to each other. Everything seemed out of place. The Great Spirit
thought he was having a bad dream. He thought, nothing could be
this imperfect.
When the Great Spirit awakened, he saw a beaver nibbling on a branch.
He realized the world of his dream became his creation. Everything
he dreamed about came true. When he saw the beaver make his home,
and a dam to provide a pond for his family to swim in, he then knew
every thing has it's place, and purpose in the time to come.
It has been told among our people from generation to generation.
We must not question our dreams. They are our creation.
